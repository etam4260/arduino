# Arduino Projects

These were small projects done throughout my high school career using arduinos. This gave a good introduction to my understand of hardware and software as well as compiled languages such as C and C++. I got to directly manipulate individual bytes and bits within the arduino as well as make sensors and wifi components functional.
